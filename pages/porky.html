                        <p style=" font-size: large;">In this industry-based assessment, I worked as part of team to deliver a prototype 
                            mobile game to the games team at Aardman Animations. I was heavily involved with developing the early concept, 
                            as well as scripting the UI and hooking it into the game mechanics. This prototype was presented at a showcase 
                            at the Bristol VR Lab where it was well received by Aardman.<br>
                            Aardman tasked us with developing a casual game promoting the upcoming series of Shaun the Sheep. 
                            Our concept for this was a farm themed tower defense game for mobile and tablet platforms, featuring the 
                            characters of the show facing off against their frequent antagonists: the pigs.<br><br>

                        <h4>Role</h4>
                        <br>
                        <p style=" font-size: large;">In the run up to our pitching session at Aardman I was responsibe for researching the mechanics 
                            of popular tower defense games and picking out the ones that would fit well with our theme and target audience. <br> 
                            Following this when developing the prototype I designed and scripted the UI system for the player to spawn sheep, hide 
                            them from the farmer, and move between scenes. <br>
                            When the prototype was ready to be built Saul and I worked together to get the iOS build ready, and I also built and 
                            Android verison to look for platform specific issues that might be worth investigating. <br>
                            I also designed and edited the Game Design Document from scratch in Microsoft Office Publisher.<br><br>

                        <h4>Context</h4>
                        <br>
                        <p style=" font-size: large;">One of the core inspirations for the feel of our prototype is <a class="grey-text text-darken-3" style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://ninjakiwi.com/Games/Tower-Defense/Bloons-Tower-Defense.html" target="_blank">Bloons Tower Defense</a> 
                            an Adobe Flash game based around popping balloons before they reached the end of the path. This mechanic 
                            of preventing an object from reaching its destination forms the core of A Porky Predicament’s gameplay, 
                            as we intended for strategic placement to be necessary to succeed. We also took inspiration from Bloon’s 
                            introduction of more enemies in later levels.<br><br>
                            We also took some cues from <a class="grey-text text-darken-3" style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.ea.com/studios/popcap/plants-vs-zombies" target="_blank">Plants vs Zombies</a>, a game in which the enemy characters 
                            have a variety of attributes that allow gameplay to remain fresh between levels, and encouraging careful 
                            strategy to win. We planned a system similar to Plants vs Zombies’ “Sun” currency, where the player would 
                            have limited resources for each level.<br><br>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="col s12 l6">
                <div class="card">
                    <div class="card-content">
                        <h4>Mechanics</h4>
                        <br>
                        <p style=" font-size: large;">The prototype contains most of the core gameplay mechanics we included in our pitch to Aardman. 
                            Once the player presses “start” they have 25 seconds seconds to position their sheep assets to bar the path of the pigs, 
                            which begin moving up from the barn when the preparation time is over.<br><br>
                            If the player has positioned the sheep poorly then the pigs will reach the farmhouse and alert the farmer to the animals’ 
                            human behaviour. If the player places their sheep well the pigs won’t reach the farmhouse in time, however the player must 
                            still press the “Bitzer” button to remove their sheep from the field before the farmer comes out and sees.<br><br>
                            In the current build the player has access to four sheep: Shirley, who is large enough to block the path but who can be 
                            moved by the pigs after a few second; Timmy, who slows down the pigs by crying loudly; Timmy’s Mother, who lays down a yarn 
                            tripwire that knocks pigs out; and Nuts, who is mad enough to charge straight at the pigs and knock them off the screen.
                            <br><br>

                </div>

        </div>

        <div class="row grey-text text-darken-3" style="text-align: left;">
            <div class="col s12 l12" style="border-radius: 8px;">

                    <div class="card-content">
                        <h4>Reflection</h4>
                        <br>
                        <p style=" font-size: large;">Although the game seems very basic and cumbersome I am very satisfied with the progress we 
                            made with it as a prototype. I feel that the decision to work on the concept as a grey box prototype allowed us to focus 
                            more on getting the essential mechanics in place, though I would have liked to make the game look nicer before showing it off. 
                            I think if we had decided to try and produce something closer to a release ready version the art side of the team would have had 
                            the opportunity to contribute more to the prototype itself rather than just generating additional concept art on the side.<br><br>
                            The major technical let down we faced with this project is the way the player positions sheep, we originally intended for this to be 
                            a grid system with predefined positions on and to either side of the path, however we were unable to get this system working, and the 
                            partial version that Sam helped us with became too broken to work with when we tried to extend it, so we rolled back to an earlier 
                            project version and started over with the current system. If we were going to continue this project with Aardman I would prioritise 
                            getting that mechanic working first, as I feel that the current method of freely dragging objects around negatively impacts how enjoyable 
                            the game is in its current form. <br><br>
                            I feel that while we worked well as a team the project could have been managed a little better, with more emphasis on using the agile system 
                            and having a clear roadmap, rather than focusing on one problem at a time.<br><br>
