                    <p style=" font-size: large;">Trouble’s Brewing is a VR game about preparing potions to fulfil
                        orders as quickly as possible.
                        In the game the player must experiment to discover the effects of ingredients at their disposal
                        and practice their technique
                        at chopping, stirring, and boiling to produce the highest quality potions. Throughout the game
                        the player will have the
                        opportunity to upgrade their equipment and explore the story of the town they work in.<br><br>
                        We presented a working prototype at the Bristol VR Lab in June 2019, and although we received
                        positive feedback I feel
                        that there is so much room to improve this project. <br><br>

                                <p style=" font-size: large;">For this project I agreed to be the scrum master for
                                    development. While we did not commit to a
                                    structured Agile development cycle, I did make the effort to set a few specific
                                    goalposts. In particular I aimed for us
                                    to have enough of our planned mechanics in the prototype that the player would be
                                    able to make a potion from scratch.
                                    I designed the game’s logo, using the <a target="_blank"
                                        href="https://fontmeme.com/fonts/potion-fushia-font/"
                                        style="text-decoration: underline;" class="grey-text text-darken-3">Potion
                                        Fushia</a> font and incorporating a few elements of the theme
                                    into the title. I was also responsible for preparing the Game Design Document for
                                    presentation at the showcase.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In terms of development I was responsible for creating original 3D assets for the
                                    game, as well a programming mechanics. I would say that I had the most input on what
                                    our prototype ended up being like, though development was more often than not
                                    democratic.

                                <p style=" font-size: large;">The primary inspiration for the game is <a target="_blank"
                                        href="http://www.ghosttowngames.com/overcooked/"
                                        style="text-decoration: underline;"
                                        class="grey-text text-darken-3">Overcooked</a>.
                                    The idea of the pace becoming more frantic as time goes on was central to the
                                    original concept we developed,
                                    though as we began to design the game the feature was put on the list of least
                                    important features.
                                    One of the features of Overcooked that remained in our concept throughout was the
                                    need for players to
                                    manage multiple tasks at the same time. Though this isn’t visible in the prototype
                                    the addition of more
                                    cauldrons and more than one quest being active at any given time introduces this
                                    challenge in Trouble’s Brewing.
                                    <br><br>
                                    We also took inspiration from <a target="_blank"
                                        href="https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/"
                                        style="text-decoration: underline;" class="grey-text text-darken-3">Skyrim</a>.
                                    While our aesthetic is much more whimsical and
                                    lighter our fantasy setting is in part informed by Skyrim’s. We borrowed the concept
                                    of ingredients having more than
                                    one function from Skyrim’s potion making mechanics and adjusted it to our own
                                    concept of ingredients working differently
                                    depending on which of the four kinds of brew the player is trying to make.

                                <p style=" font-size: large;">We started development with plans for six mechanics just
                                    within the potion brewing pipeline:
                                    chopping, grinding, filtering, stirring, boiling and bottling. Filtering was
                                    abandoned as soon as I was unable to make
                                    a pleasing model of an alembic, and we decided against bottling as having a fully
                                    formed bottle of potion appear above
                                    the cauldron better suited the style of the game.
                                    <br><br>
                                    While stirring and boiling were properly implemented, along with the ability to add
                                    ingredients to the cauldron, we
                                    were unable to find a way to introduce chopping and grinding to the prototype, and
                                    the boiling mechanic is more forgiving
                                    that the one we had planned. Therefore, in the prototype the player faces no
                                    penalties for poor technique or for not
                                    timing the boiling properly, both elements that would have factored into a quality
                                    rating system we considered as part
                                    of the “to do if we have time” list.
                                    <br><br>
                                    There were two key mechanics that we were unable to get working in time to be part
                                    of the prototype. The first was the
                                    ability to remove ingredients from the jars that populate the environment, parts of
                                    this feature were set up, but the
                                    scripts that handled it were not completed. The second, and more significant in my
                                    opinion, is the lack of names on the
                                    potions that the player produces.

                                <p style=" font-size: large;">Overall, I am very satisfied with the state of Trouble’s
                                    Brewing as it currently stands.
                                    The visual appeal of the game is very strong, I think that the combination of low
                                    poly models and the toon shader
                                    effect creates a fun environment so removed from reality that there is no risk of
                                    uncanny valley discomfort. The
                                    way the included mechanics feel and the way they interact with George’s sound work
                                    confirm that this game works
                                    better in VR that it possibly could on a conventional platform.

                                    The few issues that the current build has do not impact the player experience as
                                    much as I expected they would,
                                    however I feel that the inclusion of the missing ingredient interaction, chopping,
                                    and grinding would greatly
                                    elevate the gameplay. I also think that replacing the existing guide text, which was
                                    only included for the sake
                                    of the showcase, with a diegetic guide book for the player to read through, as well
                                    as a UI element over the remotes
                                    that show the name of what is being hovered over or held would leave the game
                                    feeling much more polished.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I would like to continue working on this project, as I feel the concept has a lot of
                                    potential,
                                    and with more time we as a team could turn it into a game worth publishing.
