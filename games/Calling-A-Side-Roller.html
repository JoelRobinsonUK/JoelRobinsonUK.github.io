                        RPGs.
                        The player chooses a class and rolls dice to determine their Strength, Constitution, Dexterity,
                        and Luck.
                        These stats govern different parts of the endless running, where the player must attack and jump
                        to survive.
                        Both of these actions, as well as everything from enemy spawn rates to loot drops, are
                        determined by the players’ stat modifiers.<br><br>

                                <p style=" font-size: large;">One of the most popular categories of web games is the
                                    endless runner.
                                    These games focus on mechanics relating to dodging obstacles that approach the
                                    player, usually from
                                    the right side of the screen as the player runs left. These obstacles are almost
                                    always procedurally
                                    generated.
                                    <br><br>
                                    My prototype project would be an endless runner designed around the gameplay
                                    fundamentals
                                    of tabletop role playing games like Dungeons and Dragons.
                                    <br><br>
                                    When the player starts the game they will be prompted to roll a twenty sided die (a
                                    D20), four times.
                                    The player would then assign their rolled numbers to four core stats: strength,
                                    dexterity, constitution,
                                    and luck. Whenever the player takes an action during a round of the game it will be
                                    affected by these stats.
                                    Modifiers are determined in a bracket fashion, as shown in this table.

                                <p style=" font-size: large;">
                                    <b style="font-size: xx-large;">Loading and Character Creation</b><br>
                                    When the game starts it checks for locally saved data. If it finds data for any of
                                    the three character slots the data will be displayed, and clicking on that slot
                                    loads the character (more on that later). If no information is found the player is
                                    presented with empty slots, clicking on one of these leads to the character creation
                                    screens (and sets the “active slot variable accordingly).
                                    First the player chooses a class, for which a string variable is assigned when they
                                    make their choice. This string is easily one of the most important variables in the
                                    game, for reasons I’ll get into soon.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Following class selection the player rolls their stat dice. When the center button
                                    is clicked the four dice on the left side of the screen display a number between 1
                                    and 20. This number is saved to an instance variable on each dice object, so that
                                    when the player drags a dice into one of the four slots on the right of the screen
                                    the displayed number is assigned to the corresponding stat. There is an issue on
                                    this screen that if the player drops one of their dice on top of another they lose
                                    the ability to separate the two dice. This is an issue I thought I had fixed early
                                    in development when I first found it, but it has returned in the current build.
                                    <br><br>

                                    <b style="font-size: xx-large;">Saving</b><br>
                                    Once the player has rolled their stats they are taken to the character review
                                    screen. They must name their character and then click save, or go back to make last
                                    minute changes to their character. When the player saves their character the UI of
                                    the character screen changes forever, the “are you happy” text is deleted, the
                                    displays for gold, level, xp, and record distance appear; along with a delete
                                    button.
                                    <br><br>
                                    After these UI changes the game creates a save slot using the “active slot”
                                    variable. This save slot stores all the static information that will never change
                                    about the character, such as name, class and base stats; without me having to
                                    individually save each piece of information. That said, some stats are saved to the
                                    local storage as well using the naming scheme of “C + active slot +
                                    _NameOfVariable”. Some of this information, like name and class, are saved so they
                                    can be shown when the game searches for character information when it loads, the
                                    rest is saved for convenient comparison and updating.

                                    <br><br>

                                    <b style="font-size: xx-large;">Actions</b><br>
                                    When the player flicks up to jump a number is generated between 1 and 20, and their
                                    dexterity modifier is added to that number. This roll is compared against a few
                                    ranges (1 to 7, 8 to 11, and 12 to 20), if the player’s roll is in the low bracket
                                    they have “failed” in their action and will not jump very high, the middle bracket
                                    gives moderate jump height, and the upper bracket gives a good jump height. If the
                                    initial number before the dexterity modifier is added is a 1 then the player will
                                    not jump at all and they will be slowed down for 10 seconds (this effect is achieved
                                    by halving the environment speed and score speed variables for that time). If the
                                    initial number is a 20 then they would receive a reward (at this time the game does
                                    not seem to give 20s).
                                    <br><br>

                                    <b style="font-size: xx-large;">Pick Ups</b><br>
                                    Every 30 seconds to a minute a pick up object will spawn and move across the screen,
                                    currently it is impossible for the player to miss these, but in later versions I
                                    would like to add some challenge.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The first pick up is a health potion, which adds 3 points of health back to the
                                    player, or if they are less than 3 points from their maximum health (max health is
                                    10 + constitution mod) then it restores them to full so as to cause no overflow.

                                    Next is a luck potion, this briefly adds 5 points to the player’s luck mod, and any
                                    events affected by the mod in this time will benefit.

                                    The speed potion multiplies the environment speed and score speed by 1.5x for 10
                                    seconds, giving the impression that the character had a sudden burst of speed.

                                    The coin pouch gives a random amount of money between 10 and 50 multiplied by the
                                    luck mod (unless luck mod is negative).

                                    The book gives an amount of XP between 5 and 25, no modifier.

                                    When the player runs out of health a lot happens.
                                    First their score is compared against the leaderboard database to determine their
                                    ranking, once the game has access to that number the gameplay layer of the game
                                    layout (which has the character, enemies and UI on it) is disabled and the post game
                                    layer is shown.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The player’s rank is displayed at the top to encourage them to play again and get
                                    higher, then their gold and XP acquisitions are shown below. If the player’s XP
                                    gains (once added to their current XP) are higher than the current level target
                                    value for that character then their level increases by one, and their XP is set to
                                    anything that exceeds the target. A text element becomes visible to indicate they’ve
                                    leveled up. Lastly the player’s distance is shown. If it’s better than their current
                                    record they are shown a banner congratulating them, and their new highscore is
                                    saved.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The player has a few options of how to proceed, they can share their score to
                                    Twitter (with different text if they break their record), play again immediately, or
                                    return to the character screen. Either of the latter options will first save the
                                    player’s score to the leaderboard database for ranking. I had intended for this to
                                    only happen when the player exceeds their high score, however when I tried this it
                                    would submit the score dozens of times.

                                    hoped it would be. I feel this is a result of my lack of experience with Construct 3
                                    as well as some of the quirks that the engine has. As it currently exists the game
                                    is finicky to a degree I feel makes it unenjoyable to play.
                                    However in the process of getting feedback several sources expressed their interest
                                    in the concept itself. One said the game was “a nice little itch scratched” in terms
                                    of its ‘Dungeons and Dragons Lite’ style of gameplay. This is exactly the aim of my
                                    original concept, and shows that there is potential in Calling.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I’m disappointed that I had to cut some content from the released game, namely the
                                    quest achievements and the gear store. I feel that with these mechanics the game
                                    would have been significantly more robust and deliver better on its promise of a
                                    simple TTRPG experience. I would be interested in continuing development of Calling:
                                    A Side Roller in my own time in order to introduce these mechanics, and in order to
                                    prepare the game fully as a Facebook instant game, which I feel is the place where
                                    the game has the best chance of success.
