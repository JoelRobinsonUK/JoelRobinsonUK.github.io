                        discovers a disused castle.
                        In a bid to make a comeback the player will turn the castle into a fully operational Monster
                        Factory, and create minions
                        of various functions and forms for the other villains of the land.The player will build and
                        upgrade equipment, complete contracts
                        by designing and producing monsters, and raid the area around their castle for materials and

                                    experiment with the character customisation options of various games to create
                                    strange results.In particular the 3 part series in which
                                    they explored the game Spore served to inspire the idea of designing your own
                                    monsters instead of them being predefined creatures. Spore itself inspired
                                    some of the mechanics behind the monster design mechanics, though ours is
                                    considerably simplified from what Maxis designed. <br><br>

                                    into the villain aspect of our game and how we don’t play as a conventional,
                                    morally white protagonist but rather the antagonist of such stories. The idea of
                                    building minions for other villains is similar to how Overlord allows you
                                    to manage your own minions and build up a small army of them to control. The
                                    inspiration from Dungeon Keeper comes from the game being centered around building
                                    specific rooms to complete a dungeon, much like our game has the player build
                                    certain machines to create their monsters.

                                    One of the core gameplay elements in Monster Factory is the expansion of the
                                    factory’s collection of machines. In the current version of the game the player can
                                    only utilise one
                                    set of ma-chines: one Sorting Machine, a Paint Cauldron, an Armourer, and a
                                    Reanimator, and as many conveyor belts in between as they choose.Because the
                                    location from which monsters
                                    spawn to be assem-bled is static the player has to set up these machines in one
                                    location, and there is no way to fork them off onto a section production line. The
                                    latter issue could be
                                    resolved by introducing a “splitter” variant of the conveyor belt, which alternates
                                    sending the monster bodies in different directions.Despite the limitation of their
                                    options the player
                                    is able to move, rotate, and delete machines from the scene at any time. In future
                                    versions it would be beneficial for the player to recover some re-sources when
                                    destroying their machines,
                                    this was not implement-ed now because it would require significant redesigning of
                                    how both machine deletion and resource management are coded.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b style="font-size: xx-large;">Resource Management</b><br>
                                    The game is heavily dependent on the resource system for the creation of machines
                                    and monsters. It is also integral to the raiding mechanic, where resources are
                                    gained. Presently raiding
                                    is the only way to get resources, however it would be better if future iterations of
                                    the game also allowed the player to directly purchase these resources as well. This
                                    is another case of
                                    the way resources are structured getting in the way of a good idea.The player can
                                    view their current amount of resources in the Resources tab, as well as their total
                                    available space.
                                    Storage is de-termined by how many crates the player has, each crate provides 100
                                    slots for each resource.Gold is also considered a resource, though it has a fixed
                                    cap of 1 million, and
                                    two other major resources: electricity and health (i.e. the integrity of the
                                    factory) were planned but were not prioritised for development.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b style="font-size: xx-large;">Contracts</b><br>
                                    The player’s objective in the game is the completion of monsters for clients. The
                                    contract lists key information to the player such as how many monsters are needed,
                                    what size they should be and what attributes they should have.
                                    In the current version of the game only two contracts exist, as the game release is
                                    intended only as a demo, it would realistically be very simple to randomly generate
                                    contracts and ensure the player has a number to choose from
                                    at all times.When the player completes the number of monsters required for the
                                    contract the monsters’ attributes and size are compared against those listed in the
                                    contract, and a score is assigned based on the percentage of matched criteria.
                                    The same percentage of the reward money is given to the player.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b style="font-size: xx-large;">Monster Creation</b><br>
                                    When the player accepts a contract they are presented with the monster creation
                                    page. Here they are given the option of assem-bling monster parts from three
                                    archetype monsters: a fishman, a zombie, and a ghoul. They can also give the monster
                                    a weapon.
                                    Each body part and weapon comes with a number of attributes, these are shown on the
                                    right side of the screen to allow the player to make sure they make the right
                                    monster. The player can also choose to make the monster large, medium, or small; and
                                    can
                                    give it a custom colour and name. The latter options are purely for the player’s
                                    amusement, though the thought behind giving the monster a name comes from the future
                                    possibility of saving the player’s creations for easy reproduction down the line.
                                    At all times the player is able to see how much the monster will cost them in
                                    resources on the right side of the screen, if the requirements exceed capacity they
                                    will be unable to create the monster. At the moment the player cannot access the
                                    monster
                                    creation menu without accepting a contract, so they would have to cancel the
                                    contract and start over if they do not create enough monsters the first time.

                                <p style=" font-size: large;">I feel this is the most complex game I’ve worked on to
                                    date in terms of programming and it’s definitely my most untidy.
                                    A lot of my code was written as isolated mechanics which I then had to mash together
                                    to turn into the game you see. I think a project of this size
                                    and ambition needed a longer period of concept design, so we could lock down our
                                    priorities better and also plan out how things would work.
                                    In particular I feel my development of the resource system was rushed and very
                                    short-sighted, for such an integral part of the game’s structure
                                    it is far too difficult to interact with in other scripts. But I know now how I
                                    could do a dozen things better than I have done on this occasion
                                    and I feel good about the knowledge I’m taking away.I’m also very proud of the team
                                    and what we’ve accomplished together. Ash’s art and Jack’s level
                                    design really give the game its own personality, and George’s contributions to the
                                    code are invaluable to the gameplay. I think we could have worked
                                    better as a team generally, we were quite disorganised and we didn’t keep ourselves
                                    to a rigid development timeline. More stringent following of an
                                    Scrum system would have helped. And at times I think the fact that we are such good
                                    friends led to difficulty in being honest with one another when
                                    we felt the work being done wasn’t up to standard. As George says I feel keeping
                                    friends and colleagues separate is the way to go.In all I think the
                                    Monster Factory we’ve released is a fantastic demonstration of what the game could
                                    become with dedicated development time when there isn’t a global
                                    pandemic happening.
