                            based on real life individuals. Each character starts with a base net worth and salary, and social standing. 
                            In each of ten rounds the player is presented with a scenario and two options of how to resolve it. 
                            The decisions made by the player affect the billionaire’s wealth and social standing. 
                            At the end of the game the player is presented with a review of their decisions and then a brief epilogue. <br><br>

                                in particular regarding their contributions to major issues such as combating climate change, world hunger. 
                                The game also addresses their treatment of workers and their less than honest approaches to paying taxes.

                            <p style=" font-size: large;">The core objective of the game is to show the target audience, working and middle class people 
                                who think billionaires are right to keep their money to themselves, that individuals with that kind of money could 
                                contribute to many important causes and still remain the richest people on Earth.
                                Further, the game aims to teach players that wealth creates wealth, and as a result the rich will continue getting 
                                richer by making decisions that negatively impact the other 99% of society.

                            <p style=" font-size: large;">Geoff Bozo Simulator begins by giving the player the choice of five billionaires to play as, 
                                each based on a member of the top ten richest people in the United States. After the player has chosen their character 
                                they are presented with the main screen. They can see their character’s company, salary, and current bank value 
                                (accurate to 2019), as well as their social standing (how the general populace feel about them). 
                                <br><br>
                                The player can also see a description of a scenario, and two buttons that show their options. The player has 60 seconds 
                                to decide on a solution to the scenario, though they can also choose to skip the round.
                                <br><br>
                                After the first round the player will begin to see a news ticker at the bottom of the screen detailing the outcome of 
                                their decision. As the player makes their decisions they will see how much money they are making in the transaction 
                                history box. Each choice will change their salary, and have an immediate cost or gain. Salary is paid into the player’s 
                                bank at the end of each round.

                            <p style=" font-size: large;">I feel that this game achieves it aims well, the message is for the most part clear to the player 
                                and the information imparted to them through it is accurate and compelling toward the point being made. I feel that there 
                                is room for the message to be made for concrete while also making its delivery more subtle. I feel at times that the game 
                                too obviously shows my personal distaste for billionaires. 
                                <br><br>
                                The development of this game has greatly improved my understanding of Unity’s UI system, and I look forward to applying 
                                this knowledge to future projects. I have also improved my general development habits through my use of GitHub for this 
                                project, and have been more successful identifying issues and resolving them.
                                <br><br>
                                I feel that in future this game could be improved by taking more time to go through each scenario, and provide greater 
                                detail to the player. Perhaps the main screen could focus on that while information such as the bank and transaction 
                                history are tidied away into a side menu. The game would also benefit from being rewritten with more neutral language, 
                                this would improve the learning outcomes by not leading the player. I also think that the end of game descriptions are 
                                not diverse enough, I would like to make them more dependent on a number of factors rather than how many of each choice 
                                the player made, as it is the social value has little function.
