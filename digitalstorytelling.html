                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I am currently very comfortable working in Unity and C#, and am becoming increasingly
                            familiar
                            with Javascript and web development. I’ve also had some experience with 3D modelling and
                            feel
                            that I am reasonably well acquainted with most aspects of asset design. I feel my real
                            strength
                            lies in the game concepts I’ve produced, both those that I’ve created prototypes of and
                            those
                            that I’m still ruminating on.
                            <br><br>
                            In the longest term my goal is to reach the role of lead game designer or producer at a
                            small or
                            medium scale studio (nothing AAA) and I already have a game idea that I think needs to be
                            saved
                            until this time to reach its full potential. Prior to this I would naturally aim to work my
                            way
                            up through the games industry, and while I do have experience with the development and
                            coding
                            side I would prefer to stay on the design side of things if I can.
                            <br><br>
                            In the medium term I would like to develop a full, but small, game entirely on my own, to a
                            higher quality than the prototypes I developed during undergrad. I have a few ideas for this
                            which would probably be very achievable. That said, the game I really want to make is a
                            fully
                            realised version of “Trouble’s Brewing”, the VR game I worked on as part of a team in second
                            year. I think that game is the most promising and interesting idea I’ve worked on.
                            <br><br>
                            Short term my goal is to continue building on my technical skill set. There are a number of
                            technologies that I feel I need to become better acquainted with before I can put out an
                            entire
                            game on my own. Chief among these is the use of databases, which I only recently started
                            working
                            with. I think I have the basics down but I can definitely get better at implementing them.
                            Ideally I’d like to learn how to use Unreal Engine, as it seems to be a more commonly used
                            tool
                            than Unity in bigger studios and would improve my employability.
                            <br><br>
                            I think for the most part completion of this masters course will boost me along the way to
                            achieving my long term goals, however it may further benefit me to get more specific
                            accreditation in some of the key tools of the trade. I am aware that LinkedIn has a system
                            of
                            awarding accreditation to listed skills on completion of tests, but I haven’t been able to
                            determine if those actually have value in the eyes of employers. I should aim to reinforce
                            my
                            portfolio considerably, cutting it down to a few more impressive projects rather than
                            showing my
                            entire history of work. Further to this I should make more effort to push my portfolio out
                            there, and establish a more noticeable online presence generally. I think working on a long
                            term
                            development project would help with this, as it would naturally generate content that I can
                            share as I progress. I’ve seen this used successfully to build online presence and to build
                            hype
                            for indie games before, so I see no reason why it wouldn’t work for me.
                            <br><br>
                            By the end of this course I hope to have my short term goals realised so I’m in a position
                            to
                            pursue the longer term ones. While I would like to generate something entirely new for the
                            Devised Project module that might also present an opportunity to begin a new effort on
                            “Trouble’s Brewing”, which I could then continue working on as I enter the workplace. If my
                            efforts to break into the game industry don’t immediately succeed (which is likely given
                            everything that’s going on in the world) I can continue to work on “Trouble’s Brewing” or
                            another project while I work casually, something I’m not actively averse to. That course
                            might
                            also provide me with time to learn Unreal Engine and other valuable technologies.

                                            I want to use a new technology or tool over the course of this module,
                                            either as the core development environment for the project or just to
                                            improve the quality of the artefact I produce. By the end of the module I
                                            want to be at least comfortable with the basics of the tool, but I aim to be
                                            confident in my ability to implement it, and in my understanding of its
                                            uses.

                                            I feel I have a serious problem with overextending myself on projects,
                                            planning too many features and trying to get them all implemented before a
                                            deadline. My goal both for this module and going forward is to limit myself
                                            to only a few features to begin with. Once these features are complete,
                                            properly functioning, and user tested, I will begin to consider additional
                                            features, one at a time. I aim to maintain a pattern of controlled
                                            iteration.

                                Trouble’s Brewing is a game about brewing potions ordered by the citizens of a fantasy
                                town.
                                The player is limited to the interior of the potion shop, and learns about the world
                                outside
                                it through potion orders and from the town crier outside their door.
                                <br><br>
                                Trouble’s Brewing was originally worked on by a team of three in a second year
                                undergraduate
                                assignment, however with the blessing of my old teammates I am now working on it
                                independently. The game was intended to be a VR experience, however due to the COVID-19
                                pandemic I was unable to access the university VR equipment and chose to convert the
                                project
                                into a traditional gameplay experience instead. Despite this I feel VR is still the best
                                way
                                to play Trouble’s Brewing.
                                <br><br>
                                In the medium term I would like to develop a full, but small, game entirely on my own,
                                to a
                                higher quality than the prototypes I developed during undergrad. I have a few ideas for
                                this
                                which would probably be very achievable. That said, the game I really want to make is a
                                fully
                                realised version of “Trouble’s Brewing”, the VR game I worked on as part of a team in
                                second
                                year. I think that game is the most promising and interesting idea I’ve worked on.
                                <br><br>
                                Commercially Trouble’s Brewing fills a space in the casual games market where narrative
                                exploration is an uncommon element of many games. It also belongs to the high fantasy
                                genre,
                                which is infrequently used in casual games and often to poor effect.

                            <p>
                                There are two potential audiences for Trouble’s Brewing, and both benefit from the
                                game’s
                                short gameplay loop.
                                <br><br>
                                The first is a casual game audience who want something to play for short periods of
                                time,
                                possibly on a commute. As each “day” in the game lasts approximately 12 minutes it can
                                be
                                experienced in small doses at any time and easily put down when needed. In order to
                                capitalise on this market the game would need to be published on portable devices such
                                as
                                the Nintendo Switch, as the gameplay would not translate well to phones.
                                <br><br>
                                The second audience is the VR gaming community. The gameplay of Trouble’s Brewing would
                                be
                                significantly enhanced on VR platforms since the potion making process could be made
                                more
                                tactile. Here again the short gameplay loop is advantageous, as playing in VR can be
                                both
                                physically and mentally tiring after short periods.

                                The story told in Trouble’s Brewing takes place entirely outside of the player’s view,
                                however one of the contracts they receive each day is issued by one of the characters
                                who
                                play a central role in the narrative. If the player completes the contract correctly
                                they
                                will see a positive outcome for this character the following day via the Town Crier, but
                                if
                                they don’t complete the contract or do so poorly they will see a negative one.

                                The player's actions have no impact on the story overall, as the aim is to create a
                                sense of
                                remote helplessness and being unable to do anything but watch. This aim is based
                                primarily
                                on the experience of being stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, but also the
                                general
                                online experience of seeing distant events unfold and being unable to act on them in a
                                meaningful way.
                                <br><br>
                                The original direction was to adapt the plot of Naomi Novik’s “Uprooted”, a
                                fantasy-folklore
                                novel, into an interactive experience where the player supports the main characters and
                                hears about the plot through second hand sources. While this concept was ultimately too
                                limiting, I retained the idea of providing narrative context through secondary sources
                                as I
                                felt that was the most appropriate method for the experience I aimed to recreate. This
                                method is used to good effect in “Papers Please”, where the player occasionally reads
                                about
                                the individuals they allow over the border in newspapers later on.
                                <br><br>
                                Moving on from this approach I decided to rework the narrative from an original work of
                                mine
                                to fit this game. The first arc of a Dungeons and Dragons campaign I led, “Tales from
                                the
                                Sleepless City”, served very well for the purposes of Trouble’s Brewing, as the
                                narrative
                                had built in points where certain characters had to achieve certain goals, and many of
                                the
                                potions that can be made in Trouble’s Brewing could be used to assist in doing so.

                            <p>
                                Unity was the only logical choice for developing this project, as the first iteration of
                                Trouble’s Brewing was built in Unity. In addition Unity is my strongest development
                                environment, and so to create an appealing product it was best to play to my strengths.
                                <br><br>
                                As previously mentioned Trouble’s Brewing was originally a VR game and over the course
                                of developing this non-VR version I began to see that it would play much better on its
                                original platform. 
                                <br><br>
                                In lieu of being able to develop for VR I decided to deploy Trouble’s
                                Brewing via Unity WebGL, for a couple of reasons. The first is that it makes testing
                                very easy, rather than having to get playtesters to install various versions of the game
                                I am able to update a single version and ask for feedback. The second reason is
                                discoverability, services like itch.io make establishing independently developed games
                                without the support of a publisher much easier, and comes without the costs associated
                                with Steam and other mainstream platforms.
