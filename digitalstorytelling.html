                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I am currently very comfortable working in Unity and C#, and am becoming increasingly
                            familiar
                            with Javascript and web development. I’ve also had some experience with 3D modelling and
                            feel
                            that I am reasonably well acquainted with most aspects of asset design. I feel my real
                            strength
                            lies in the game concepts I’ve produced, both those that I’ve created prototypes of and
                            those
                            that I’m still ruminating on.
                            <br><br>
                            In the longest term my goal is to reach the role of lead game designer or producer at a
                            small or
                            medium scale studio (nothing AAA) and I already have a game idea that I think needs to be
                            saved
                            until this time to reach its full potential. Prior to this I would naturally aim to work my
                            way
                            up through the games industry, and while I do have experience with the development and
                            coding
                            side I would prefer to stay on the design side of things if I can.
                            <br><br>
                            In the medium term I would like to develop a full, but small, game entirely on my own, to a
                            higher quality than the prototypes I developed during undergrad. I have a few ideas for this
                            which would probably be very achievable. That said, the game I really want to make is a
                            fully
                            realised version of “Trouble’s Brewing”, the VR game I worked on as part of a team in second
                            year. I think that game is the most promising and interesting idea I’ve worked on.
                            <br><br>
                            Short term my goal is to continue building on my technical skill set. There are a number of
                            technologies that I feel I need to become better acquainted with before I can put out an
                            entire
                            game on my own. Chief among these is the use of databases, which I only recently started
                            working
                            with. I think I have the basics down but I can definitely get better at implementing them.
                            Ideally I’d like to learn how to use Unreal Engine, as it seems to be a more commonly used
                            tool
                            than Unity in bigger studios and would improve my employability.
                            <br><br>
                            I think for the most part completion of this masters course will boost me along the way to
                            achieving my long term goals, however it may further benefit me to get more specific
                            accreditation in some of the key tools of the trade. I am aware that LinkedIn has a system
                            of
                            awarding accreditation to listed skills on completion of tests, but I haven’t been able to
                            determine if those actually have value in the eyes of employers. I should aim to reinforce
                            my
                            portfolio considerably, cutting it down to a few more impressive projects rather than
                            showing my
                            entire history of work. Further to this I should make more effort to push my portfolio out
                            there, and establish a more noticeable online presence generally. I think working on a long
                            term
                            development project would help with this, as it would naturally generate content that I can
                            share as I progress. I’ve seen this used successfully to build online presence and to build
                            hype
                            for indie games before, so I see no reason why it wouldn’t work for me.
                            <br><br>
                            By the end of this course I hope to have my short term goals realised so I’m in a position
                            to
                            pursue the longer term ones. While I would like to generate something entirely new for the
                            Devised Project module that might also present an opportunity to begin a new effort on
                            “Trouble’s Brewing”, which I could then continue working on as I enter the workplace. If my
                            efforts to break into the game industry don’t immediately succeed (which is likely given
                            everything that’s going on in the world) I can continue to work on “Trouble’s Brewing” or
                            another project while I work casually, something I’m not actively averse to. That course
                            might
                            also provide me with time to learn Unreal Engine and other valuable technologies.

                                            I want to use a new technology or tool over the course of this module,
                                            either as the core development environment for the project or just to
                                            improve the quality of the artefact I produce. By the end of the module I
                                            want to be at least comfortable with the basics of the tool, but I aim to be
                                            confident in my ability to implement it, and in my understanding of its
                                            uses.

                                            I feel I have a serious problem with overextending myself on projects,
                                            planning too many features and trying to get them all implemented before a
                                            deadline. My goal both for this module and going forward is to limit myself
                                            to only a few features to begin with. Once these features are complete,
                                            properly functioning, and user tested, I will begin to consider additional
                                            features, one at a time. I aim to maintain a pattern of controlled
                                            iteration.
