                        <br><br><br>
                        <p>From the group ideation activities carried out in the Hackathon session the theme of
                            “Connections” stuck out from the three.
                            <br><br>
                            I began to think in terms of interpersonal connections, and reflected that in my
                            previous attempts to create a narrative I have never managed to create rich
                            interconnected webs of characters who know one another. Often I had one character, who
                            knew another, then another in a narrow chain; my worlds always felt very small as a
                            result.
                            <br><br>
                            I envisioned a tool where a user working on a narrative could input their protagonist
                            and generate a web of characters connected to them including friends, family, enemies
                            etc. This is the idea we decided to go for as a team.

                        <span class="card-title left" style="font-weight: 700; font-size: xx-large;">Prototyping</span>
                        <br><br><br>
                        <p>As a team we discussed how the connection generator concept could be improved, as my initial
                            idea was fairly limited in content. I was resistant to the idea of creating fully fleshed
                            out characters as I considered this more of a guide tool for creators, and I didn’t want it
                            to disrupt their preexisting ideas.
                            <br><br>
                            We settled on the idea of generating semi complete profiles for the characters with a
                            randomised name and a few suggested traits the user might want to give them. We then
                            considered how these traits might be given more depth; we decided that we could give the
                            user the ability to input the traits of their protagonist and generate compatible traits for
                            characters with whom they have a positive relationship and contrasting traits in those they
                            have negative relationships with.
                            <br><br>
                            Based on these decisions we created a simple paper prototype and ran through it a
                            few
                            times,
                            creating webs around a character and figuring out a kind of interpersonal narrative.
                            We
                            found that labelling the individual connections between each character limited our
                            ability
                            to come up with interesting stories, so we decided instead to simplify our
                            connections
                            from
                            specific labels such as “family” or “friends” to “positive”, “neutral”, and
                            “negative”
                            relationships which are open to the user’s interpretation.

                        <p>
                            Between meetings I had sketched out a wireframe for how we might present the options
                            they
                            user has and how they would view their generated web. I showed this to Nishesh,
                            whose work
                            in UX design made him the best candidate to handle the front end, and he began
                            designing
                            higher fidelity prototypes.

                        <p>
                            As we decided that a Javascript based approach was going to be the best way of
                            presenting
                            this product to users Ben took charge of back end development, he started work on
                            the
                            technical structure of the product immediately.
                            <br><br>
                            Wik and I began generating lists of names and traits so Ben had enough data to work
                            with,
                            later we may seek out existing databases of names to create a more random
                            generation.

                </div>
            </div>

            <br>

            <div class="col s12 l12">
                <div class="card">

                    <div class="card-content">

                        <p>

                        <div class="row">
                            <p>
                                After settling on a JavaScript based application we realised that Ben was the only
                                member of
                                the team who had sufficient experience with it, so we made the switch to Unity so I
                                could be
                                more useful.
                                <br><br>
                                I took Nishesh’s prototype designs and built a UI in Unity that matched it. I
                                ensured that
                                the interface allowed the user to input a name for their main character as well as a
                                few key
                                traits they have. Later we decided it would be easier to just have one positive and
                                one
                                negative trait, so changed that.
                                <br><br>
                            </p>

                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col s12 l8 offset-l2">

                            <p>
                                I animated the interface using LeanTween, an asset from the Unity asset store, to
                                give it a
                                little bit more initial polish.
                                <br><br>
                                Because we’re no longer using a web based approach it will take more work to make
                                the app
                                look polished, so Wik has been assigned the task of creating some assets.

                        <p>
                            Ben developed the back end of the project solo using the MongoDB database program, and
                            JavaScript. [Maybe insert more about his work here?]. With that set up he and I worked
                            together to integrate it into the Unity project. After a deal of trial and error we found a
                            package on the asset store called Json .Net for Unity, which provided a lot of the code we
                            needed to interact with our database.
                            <br><br>
                            We scripted the program so that when it loads it sends a request to each page of the
                            database one at a time and adds each piece of data to the corresponding array in Unity. In
                            theory we could have cut out the middle-man and accessed the data directly from the database
                            whenever it was required, but I thought it would be easier to develop the rest of the
                            functionality using arrays. <i>[Update: I was absolutely right]</i>
                            <br><br>
                            Once we had successfully begun pulling data down from the database we set it up to
                            dynamically populate the dropdowns for traits and flaws when the program loads.
                            <br><br>
                            Ben had the idea to use the users to expand the supply of names for generated characters.
                            This idea proved harder to implement so Ben will be attempting to address it while I
                            continue with the rest of the Unity development.

                        <br><br><br>
                        <p>
                            My initial approach to generating the visuals for the character generator was to instantiate
                            a prefabricated object with slots for data that would be randomised when the user hit
                            ‘generate’. However due to the way Unity UI works I couldn’t effectively accomplish this
                            without the objects, which I have come to refer to as “nodes”, overlapping.
                            <br><br>
                            I also found that having the nodes randomly positioned made it more difficult to identify
                            their degree of separation from the user’s protagonist. So I suggested to the team that
                            having concentric circles of pre-existing nodes that are hidden and activated at random
                            would be a more achievable approach and, with their support, designed this functionality.
                            The practical outcome of this decision is that the first degree of separation from the
                            protagonist has only 8 nodes, which seems a reasonable number of characters to have a direct
                            relationship with a user’s protagonist, with each subsequent degree of separation doubling
                            the number of nodes.

                            In order to accommodate these changes I also had to set some limitations to the user’s
                            options in the modifiers panel. Their selected maximum degree of separation would determine
                            how many connections could be generated in total. For example if they chose 2 degrees of
                            separation they would be limited to 24 connections (8 for the first circle of nodes plus 16
                            for the second). I also set the limit of degrees of separation to 5, as this approach
                            requires me to manually position these nodes and there is a limit to how sensible spending
                            time doing that is.
                            <br><br>
                            Once the nodes were spawning correctly I turned my attention to presenting the data they
                            contain that is not immediately visible on the display. As the nodes are fairly small even
                            they names of the characters can end up fitting poorly, so I used the empty panel at the
                            bottom of the interface to show the name more clearly, as well as listing the character’s
                            suggested traits and flaws.
                            <br><br>

                        <p>
                            I achieved this by adding event listeners to the node objects that determine when the cursor
                            is hovering over them and sets the text of the panel to show the data stored in the node.
                            When the cursor is not hovering over a node the scale of the text in the panel is set to
                            zero. This ensures that it isn’t visible but is still accessible to the event listener.
                            <br><br>
                            There is room in this panel for more information about characters to be added such as
                            suggestions on their backstory, however I feel that adding more would begin to over burden
                            the user with constraints to their own narrative.

                        <p>
                            To draw the lines between nodes I had to use the open source UnityUIExtensions project, as
                            Unity’s existing LineRenderer component is designed for 3D space rather than for use with
                            the UI.
                            <br><br>
                            The UI Extensions library included a line renderer component that I attached to a prefab
                            object. For each node that is activated when the user presses generate a new instance of
                            this object is created and the start/end points of the line are set to the position of the
                            new node, and the position of another randomly selected node.
                            <br><br>
                            If the newly activated node is in the first layer of separation then the line is set to
                            connect it to the protagonist. This part was easy to implement and I had aimed to have nodes
                            in the second layer only link to those in the first (and nodes in the third layer to the
                            second and so on), however it was difficult once the nodes were activated to define which
                            ones belonged to which layer.
                            <br><br>
                            There is an issue where some lines will draw through other nodes on the way to their
                            destination, this was slightly assuaged by positioning the container object I created for
                            the lines behind the one for the nodes in draw order. It still doesn’t look great and I
                            looked into ways of connecting only nodes within a certain distance from one another, but
                            couldn’t find a serviceable solution.
                            <br><br>
                            For reasons I have been unable to identify UnityUIExtensions doesn’t allow lines to have
                            their colours changed beyond very rudimentary RGB values such as 255,0,0. This makes the
                            lines look garish and will complicate matters if we decide on a certain colour palette for
                            the tool that doesn't play well with pure bright red and green.
                            <br><br>
                            This part of the project has by far been the most fraught, as there are problems with the
                            lines generated not being hidden by the UI mask on the display panel (which is meant to keep
                            all the generated content neatly contained), and with some nodes not getting any connections
                            at all.

                        <br><br><br>
                        <p>
                            Throughout the process of developing this tool we discussed a number of possible features
                            that could be implemented but weren’t a priority and would require a lot more development
                            time.
                            <br><br>
                            The most significant of these in terms of making the tool as valuable as possible is saving.
                            Allowing users to access their previous character generations and edit them if need be would
                            make the tool more useful beyond the planning stages of narrative development.
                            <br><br>
                            The most logical approach would be to have save files that the user can access via the tool;
                            however this would require the use of user authentication and expansion of our database, as
                            the tool is currently only accessible via browser.
                            <br><br>
                            Alternatively we could export the data from the tool as a standalone file. If we took this
                            approach I would look to have the exported file be accessible independently from the tool,
                            for example the web of characters could be shown via an image file. If the details included
                            with the characters prove useful and popular with users we would likely have to create a
                            file that can be read back into the tool at a later time so that those details can once
                            again be displayed.
                            <br><br>
                            Early on we also discussed the possibility of having different genres for the user to choose
                            from, each with appropriate names and traits for the characters. In addition to these
                            surface level changes we could also begin to explore different kinds of relationship
                            connections with more nuance depending on genre tropes (for example the inclusion of an
                            older mentor figure in fantasy and science fiction, ie Gandalf or Obi-Wan).
                            <br><br>
                            I feel that generating webs in this way would create much more organic, unique assistance to
                            the user.

                            Below is the feedback offered by a graduate of Bath Spa’s Creative Writing course, I asked
                            her to use the character generation tool and use the results to create a rough narrative
                            involving the interpersonal relationships the tool gave her.

                            Overall I really like the product. It’s a good way to develop a story as what often delays
                            the plotting process is coming up with the characters and deciding what their relationships
                            to each other are. This tool offers prompts to help with that process.

                            I think the most significant part of this feedback is the idea of including dreams and fears
                            for the characters. During development I was worried about burdening the user with an excess
                            of information they didn’t want, so we limited output to a few suggested traits; however it
                            seems that at least some users would appreciate some expanded character details while
                            planning their narratives.
                            <br><br>
                            With some more development time the best approach to this would be to include this
                            additional characterisation, but give the user an options menu where they can disable these
                            details if they don’t want them

                        <p>
                            The tool as it currently exists is a good proof of concept for an original concept. The idea
                            has practical value to the intended audience of writers and narrative designers, and if we
                            were to continue with development and promotion I expect it would get reasonable support.

                        <p>
                            This project was not well suited to a group of this size. While myself and Ben were able to
                            contribute quite significantly on the front and back end respectively Nishesh and Wiktor had
                            little to do through no fault of their own.
                            <br><br>
                            Nishesh’s experience with UX/UI were essential for me to be able to create a usable
                            interface but after his initial high fidelity prototype his work had little bearing on the
                            tool. Similarly Wiktor was very good in the early stages of the project at critically
                            reviewing the ideas we came up with and helped to narrow down the scope of our work early
                            on.
                            <br><br>
                            I was only able to contribute as much as I did after we made the decision to use Unity, if
                            we had stuck with our plan to develop the front end in HTML and Javascript Ben would have
                            likely been the only contributor to this project. His work on the back end database is
                            probably one of the most valuable parts of the project, as it allows the content within the
                            tool to expand dynamically with the inclusion of new names.
                            <br><br>
                            As a team I feel we took a while to get the ball rolling on the project and so lost some
                            valuable development time, however once we got moving we did well avoiding scope creep which
                            could have quickly over encumbered the original concept.
                            <br><br>
                            We could have communicated more effectively over the course of the project, not just in
                            terms of frequency but in terms of thoroughly explaining what we envisioned for the project.
                            Though I can’t be certain I am confident that throughout development everyone has had a
                            different idea of how the tool is intended to work.

                        <p>
                            For the most part I feel I did justice to the concept I presented to the team at the
                            Hackathon. I had hoped to take this opportunity to expand my knowledge of Javascript by
                            developing the front end in HTML canvas, but practically my existing knowledge of these
                            tools would have resulted in a much poorer outcome for the project. I played well to my
                            strengths in Unity and am happy with how quickly I was able to produce the current visuals.
                            <br><br>
                            However I think a lot of the ways I implemented functionality are faulty and short sighted.
                            I had initially aimed for the generation of nodes to be procedural, and I think now I should
                            have persevered with this line of thought rather than creating preplaced nodes. That
                            decision has resulted in the outcome feeling slightly limited, as I could only get two rings
                            of nodes ready.
                            <br><br>
                            Ultimately I think I made a good contribution to the project and I am content with the
                            outcome as a proof of concept. I would enjoy further developing the character relationship
                            tool later on, as I feel it has value to all kinds of creatives.
