                            Concept</span>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Floriofeel is a mood tracking app that uses imagery of flowers based on Victorian era
                            floriology (the language and meanings of flowers). This concept is based on one I developed
                            in the ideation session for the collaborative project, however it was sidelined as its link
                            to “connection” was tenuous.
                            <br><br>
                            When I brought the concept back for this project I tried to identify how it would be used,
                            when I first developed the idea in October the general plan was that the service would be a
                            kind of anonymous messaging platform, where users would be connected based on the flower the
                            had selected, and would be able to communicate with one another in small groups (I
                            envisioned 2 to 10 people). Users would support one another through their mutually
                            experienced feelings using predefined phrases or iconography.
                            <br><br>
                            On review of this concept I decided that users supporting one another would not be
                            particularly constructive, and it would be essential to make sure the app could not be
                            exploited to cause anyone harm. I was not confident that I could effectively design a system
                            that would prevent this, nor that I could come to understand the fundamentals of peer to
                            peer messaging services in the given timeframe.
                            <br><br>
                            As such I decided to focus on using the flower imagery for a self contained, personal mood
                            tracking app. In this instance the user would use the app entirely for their own benefit, it
                            would offer a quick and easy way to save the way they’re feeling at a certain time so they
                            can reflect on it at their own pace. The user would be able to select the flower that
                            represents their current feeling and be shown how many users had also felt that way in the
                            last hour, they would also be able to add notes for their own reference.
                            <br><br>
                            Two of the modifiers lend themselves to this concept. “Monochrome” will guide the look and
                            feel of the app interface, while “elevate” led to the idea of the app giving users small
                            activities they might undertake to improve their mood (or make the most of a good mood).

                        <br>
                        <p>I knew I wanted the landing page of the app to feature a flowering meadow as its background,
                            so I set about searching for one that seemed appropriate. Having found one (iStock, 2014) I
                            uploaded it to an image to palette generator at hexcolor.co, this website gave me a wide
                            range of colours picked directly from the image. I picked a shade of light purple that I
                            felt would be a good neutral accent for the app that still was still floral in feel.
                            <br><br>

                        <p>
                            Once I had this core colour selected I put it into the Adobe Color palette tool and looked
                            through the options it gave. I did briefly consider the complementary palette, as it had a
                            promising range of colours. However based on some of the feedback I received about the image
                            the palette was extracted from I was afraid that the greens would cause the app to have the
                            feel of a gardening focused app. I didn’t want to become too heavily entrenched in plant
                            imagery, I only wanted the app to have a vaguely floral sense. I ended up choosing the
                            monochrome pale including a good range of shades that will give the app a consistent look
                            while still having variety.

                            I only settled on the name Floriofeel as I began to design the main logo of the app. The
                            original logo used the Ebrima font, and a flower icon taken from Flaticon (Freepik, 2020).

                        <p>
                            I intended to use the monochrome version as the yellow was both hard to see on the landing
                            page and contrasted too much with the accent colour of the navigation bar. However based on
                            feedback from Nishesh, who has plenty of UX experience, I use the logo with yellow
                            colouring, as it was suggested that version was easier to read for the most part.
                            <br><br>
                            Later in the development process when I settled on the flowers I would be using to present
                            emotions, I found that the pack of icons I used for the prototype (Freepik, 2020) had most

                        <p>
                            In order to give the app more of its own visual identity I searched for a custom font from
                            the google fonts library. I settled on “Quicksand”, a sans serif font with rounded lettering
                            that matches the rounded elements of the app interface.
                            <br><br>
                            After adding icons and the font I realised that the logo no longer fit with the look of the
                            app.
                            I designed a new logo that incorporated one of the unused icons from the flowers pack. The
                            daisy had a yellow center that reminded me of the existing logo so I used that, and I
                            employed the Quicksand font with a black outline for a cohesive style.

                            felt that way, as neither page had much content on it otherwise. I feel that this page ended
                            up becoming one of the most important aspects of the app. It delivers the core value of the
                            app to the user, and does so in an effective and appealing way.

                        <br>
                        <p>I had intended to develop this app in Construct, a Javascript based mobile game engine.
                            However on further reflection I decided that the limitations of construct (such having to
                            manually position elements) outweighed the benefit of my being familiar with the software.
                            <br><br>
                            To that end I made the decision to build Floriofeel as a Progressive Web App, I have had
                            some experience developing the front end of a PWA before and so was able to quickly generate
                            the interface almost exactly as I designed it in the user journey.
                            <br><br>
                            Using PWA technologies allows for easy testing and quick deployment between versions. It
                            also presents an opportunity to learn more about Javascript and web technologies, a branch
                            of development that I haven’t had much experience in previously.

                        <br>
                        <p>I decided to use Google’s Firebase database for the back end of the application, as it seems
                            the easiest to learn of the options available to me. Firebase also includes functionality
                            for user authentication alongside its database, making it the obvious choice for user
                            accounts.
                            <br><br>
                            The database contains information about the nine flower options the user has to choose from,
                            which are loaded into the app from the database whenever needed. Having this data stored
                            there instead of locally in the app makes it easier for me to update or replace the
                            information when necessary.

                            The database also stores the users’ previous choices, so their history is persistent across
                            devices when they’re logged in. I achieved this by creating a new document in the database
                            whenever a user signs up, with the user’s UID token as the name of the document.
                            <br><br>
                            <i>I am aware from my research while developing this functionality that using the UID is not
                                best practice, however I had issues using Firebase’s included GetToken() function, so
                                for
                                this prototype I simply chose to use something I knew would work.</i>

                            Whenever the user selects a flower from the homepage of the app it sends an update to the
                            “history” collection saved in their document, with all the key information about the flower,
                            as well as the time and date that they logged their feelings. The most important piece of
                            data stored in each entry is a timestamp number with a “-” appended to the front. This
                            allows me to sort by the timestamp when retrieving the user’s history, and have their data
                            displayed newest to oldest.

                            When the user views their history a card is generated for each entry in their database
                            document. They can open these cards to find a couple of functionality options.
                            <br><br>
                            If the user hasn’t written a note yet they will see a text area where they can add a note
                            giving more detail about their feelings at that time. Once they’ve written a note it is
                            pushed to the entry’s document in the database and displayed as normal text in the modal
                            card. Existing notes can be edited using the pencil button.

                            The user can also delete entries from their history at any time using the red trash can
                            button, this deletes the entry permanently from the database and reloads the history page.

                            Near the end of the development process I had the opportunity to collect feedback from
                            fellow course members. This feedback helped me identify a few minor issues with the app, but
                            it also helped to define areas where the app met my expectations.

                            Here the responses showed me that for the most part the app has all the features users might
                            expect from it, however this question was marred by the lack of data available for the app
                            to
                            present, which made it seem broken in places. Also, the question in response 'b' about only
                            being able to add a note once raised concerns that the app is not sufficiently intuitive and
                            may need some onboarding for new users.

                                        <li>No - the app is well streamlined. It seems to include only features that

                        <p>
                            Again these responses largely reassured me that the core functionality of the app was well
                            thought out. However response 'f' stating that showing the number of other people feeling
                            the same way as the user was sometimes unnecessary made me reconsider the selection of
                            emotions available to the user. I assume that this response refers to the more positive
                            emotions, where the user may not need to feel supported, however I feel it is beneficial to
                            make the app a place for positive and negative emotions, and for functional consistency
                            these numbers should be shown for both.

                                        <li>quite a lot, just the placement of icons in the feedback popup is very
                                            close, need to provide more real estate in that. Also, if the names of the
                                            flowers are shown alongwith the images that would be easier to understand
                                            rather than clicking on one flower and reading the details at the bottom of

                                        <li>It is fairly self explanatory however I have a couple of suggestions: 1)
                                            highlight the flower that the user selects (it's easy to miss that the text
                                            has changed) and 2) Change 'View History' to 'View My History'</li>
                                        <br>
                                        <li>I found myself looking for a button to get pick to the screen where you pick
                                            flowers in one click rather than pressing back multiple times.</li>
                                        <br>
                                        <li>It is easy to use and look at, quite user friendly
                                        </li>
                                        <br>
                                        <li>It is friendly and easy to navigate, but there are certain areas that it
                                            would be beneficial to have some hierarchy with specific UI elements. Making
                                            it easier to understand the flow. For example some of the buttons are rather
                                            small, this could be difficult for specific users.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </div>

                        <p>
                            The respondents are largely supportive of the app's UI, however there were a few valuable
                            insights that led to changes in the app.
                            <br><br>
                            The suggestion from response 'd' to highlight the
                            currently selected flower was a feature that existed in the app before it was removed during
                            Firebase intergration, so I happily added it back. I also changed "View history" to "View my
                            History", so the user better understands what the button is for.
                            <br><br>
                            I also recognised the
                            suggestion from response 'c' to display the name of the flower or the emotion it represents
                            alongside the icon on the button, however I believe that by slightly obscuring this
                            information users are encouraged to remember the features of the app and more thoroughly
                            develop connections between the flowers and the emotions they represent in they mind.

                                            information is presented to the user about what he can do to make himself

                                        <li>There are some issues with iOS. I was not able to see the list of
                                            suggestions in the 'You are not alone' screen, flowers did not add to the
                                            history for about 30 seconds or so, and the 'View History' and 'Sign Out'
                                            text were below the buttons.</li>
                                        <br>
                                        <li>I kept thinking I would be able to click on the white box with 'If you're
                                            feeling ___, consider' in it.</li>

                        <p>
                            Again these responses were affected by the lack of data ready for the app to use, however as
                            response 'd' notes there are a number of issues with the app across the multiple platforms
                            it can be accessed from. During development my testing was limited to Android and Google
                            Chrome, however I know from resolving a few other issues there are a number of elements to
                            HTMl and CSS that are platform specific, so resolving these issues likely lies in providing
                            platform appropriate code.
                            <br><br>
                            Also, responses 'b' and 'g' point out issues with elements of the app not loading quickly
                            enough, I am aware that in various places I have not written asynchronous processes
                            effectively, however with my limited understanding of Javascript I have been unable to
                            respolve these issues.

                                    Do you feel that app does what it sets out to do (provide a space for users to document and reflect on their feelings in personal manner)?</div>

                        <p>
                            Finally, these responses indicate that the app serves the intended purpose. However it would
                            benefit from aspects being made easier to understand, as well as additional onboarding, as
                            it should be noted I presented the app to the group with limited explanation in order to
                            gauge how intuitive the app's interface was.

                            Overall I feel this project has been a success. The product provides all of the essential
                            functionality I had intended for it with limited technical issues. There is room for
                            additional functionality using the Firebase API to create push notifications, which are a
                            central element in most serious apps, however this would require upgrading to a paid
                            Firebase package. The visuals of the app have met my expectations and they have largely been
                            approved of by test users, however the app would likely benefit from a brief onboarding when
                            users open it for the first time.
                            <br><br>
                            I feel the implementation of my code has been inconsistent within this project, and the
                            product could see a significant performance boost if I had taken the time to ensure best
                            practices were applied. As this was my first project creating a progressive web app I feel I
                            should have spent more time familiarising myself with the standards of the field and made
                            more effort to ensure my work was optimised.
